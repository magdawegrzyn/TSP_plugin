The first point, is indicated as the starting and final point of the trip. The input data is a point layer, the result is a line layer with the indicated route. Attributes of this layer are the length of the route and the duration of the trip, as well as the order of the places visited in a descriptive form. User can provide his own Google Maps API or OpenRouteService API keys.
